# Negroni Skeleton

I often need to kick off new Negroni projects (usually APIs and microservices) so this project offers up all the boilerplate.

## Getting Started

This sketon should work with minimal setup

1. Install gin
  * `go get github.com/codegangsta/gin`
2. Run with gin (ensure your pwd is this cloned repo)
  * `gin`
3. Test the server
  * `curl http://127.0.0.1:3000`
